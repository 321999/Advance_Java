types of java addition 
	normal(jse ,core java)
	java enterprise(addition of java,jee,j2ee) 
	java micron 
purpose of diifereren addtion:
	JSE 
		swing
		     swing is a library of java which is set of gui components,and tools for building destoop application 
		Applet
		     Applet is an computer program that perform speccific task 
			usign JSE we can build standalone application (if an application needs to be install on a platform to be used such kind application is called are standalone applcation ex:vlc media)
	JEE
		We can build web application with the help of (applicationn which is going to be deployed on the server os known as web application)
		To build web applicatio we can take the help of servlet or spring (intagram,amazon)
	JME 
		java micro addtion is a subset of java platform which is designed for resource constraint devices such as mobile phones
		opera mini ,nokia naps ,google maps(earliesr version) 
	Mvc ARCHITECTURE 

 data logic,where getters an setters 
 	#View (user interface)
  	* it represents current models state 
   	* it takes input from user and display output to user

 	#Controller(buisiness logic)
  	* controlles and decides how data is dipllayed
   	* 
    # what is MVC ARchitecture ?
    	* it is software architecture pattern commonly used in development of appllication 
     	* particularly in context with web applicatio and desktop applcation 
      	* it is away to orgainise and structure a code to enhance the maintainability modularity and scalability 
       ** package declaration 
	##Naming convention
 ```
	domain_extension.organisation_name.project_name.controller
  	domain_extension.organisation_name.project_name.view
   	gov.uidai.library.model
	com.indian_website. gov
 ```
## JDBC 
java to database connectivity 
* whenever we write java program and whenever that program need to communicate with the database we need jdbc api
* jdbc api stands as an interface between java program and the database
* jdbc api is an only api which helps to eastablish connection between java program and database
# API 
* Application programing interface
* an api set of rules and protocols that defines how diffferent software component should interact with each other
* it provides structuure and standardise way for different application or modules to communicate an exchange data

  data:
  data is an information about entity

  ### data storage solution
  	data storage is a concern which deals with where and how we store inforamtion
  	* File storage
  	* database

Advance java

| File storage         | database |
|--------------|:-----:|-----------:|
| Provide less security  |  Provide more security  |        739 |
| No efficient query processing|  Efficient query processing  |          6 |
|Less complexity to hanldle|Complex to handle |


Add headings (Format > Paragraph styles) and they will appear in your table of contents.
||	File storage || database||
Provide less security 
No efficient query processing 
Less complexity to hanldle
Database:
Provide more security 
Efficient query processing 
Complex to handle 
Database is the place where we store the data in structure or in organised manner 
  
## how does jdbc helps

suppose java application need to comuunicate with the database then we will take the help fo jdbc api
jdbc api will now convert any java instruction into database understandable language
so we need something which can do conversion work 

### Driver software will help to convert java istruction to database java understandable language and vice versa

# who will provide the driver software 
driver software is provided by the database vendors 
jdbc api is independent of database 
where driver software iw dependent of software
